### **[EN:]** (translated)
Hello!
This is an extension for turbowarp (turbowarp.org), specifically for turbowarp, as you can't insert it into scratch.
By the way, I made this extension in collaboration with the AI ​​gemini (oh... when will I learn JavaScript...)
### **How ​​do I use this extension???**
It's very easy to use!!! (It's easy because there's only one block)
Here's an example where I use it: (word: text, color: green, font: Pixel)

If you want to return the sprite to its original appearance (so it's not just text),
then simply change the costume using the block to a different one or the same costume.

It also works very well with the extension pen

### **How ​​do I run it???**
Very easy, Extensions --> User Extension ---> "Text" and enter the code in the field.

I also want to note that you MUST check the "Enable without sandbox" box.
Otherwise, it simply won't work. It'll work...
